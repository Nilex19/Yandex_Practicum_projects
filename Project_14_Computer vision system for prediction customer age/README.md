#  Computer vision system for prediction customer age

Supermarket chain Good Seed is introducing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photofixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
- Analyze purchases and offer products that may interest buyers in particular age groups
- Monitor clerks selling alcohol

We need to build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. We have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.  
The data was downloaded from http://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/dataset/26/description/#. It is stored in the /datasets/faces/ folder.
