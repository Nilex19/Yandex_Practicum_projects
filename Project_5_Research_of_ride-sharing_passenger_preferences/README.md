# Research of ride-sharing passenger preferences

*Zuber* is a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Our task is to find patterns in the available information. We want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.  
We'll study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
