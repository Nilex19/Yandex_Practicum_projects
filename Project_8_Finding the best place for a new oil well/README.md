# Finding the best place for a new oil well

Our task is to find the best place for a new oil well of the OilyGiant mining company.
We have data on oil samples from 3 regions. The data set for each region has 100,000 oil wells with measured oil quality and volume of reserves. We need to build a machine learning model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. We'll analyze potential profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.
