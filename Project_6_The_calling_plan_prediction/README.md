# The calling plan prediction

Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. We need to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.  

We have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. For this classification task, we need to develop a model that will pick the right plan.  

The threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.
