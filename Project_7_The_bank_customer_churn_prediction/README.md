# The bank customer churn prediction

Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.

We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. We have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.

We build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. We need an F1 score of at least 0.59.
Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.
